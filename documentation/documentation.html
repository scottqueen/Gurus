    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="colors">Colors &amp; Styling</h2>
        <p>The main stylesheet is located in the <span class="location">css/</span> folder, and a copy, that we recommend you edit instead
        of the original if you use the configuration interface to apply changes, is located in the <span class="location">config/product/css/</span> folder.</p>
        <p>OffTheShelf ships with a variety of colours, backgrounds and textures as presets. You can use the configuration interface to select a preset (or design your own).
        <p>Please keep in mind that changes to the original <span class="location">style.css</span> file will be overwritten by the configuration interface
        whenever you save your settings. To avoid this, make all your changes to <span class="location">config/product/css/style.css.php</span> instead, as those
        changes will be preserved. You may also choose to create an additional file, like <span class="location">custom.css</span>, and include this
        file in your template in addition to <span class="location">style.css</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="fonts">Fonts and Typography</h2>
        OffTheShelf uses <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a>. To change
        titles, just change the link located within <span class="location">"index.html"</span>
        marked <span class="location">"'http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,300,600|Bree+Serif"</span> and open <span
            class="location">"styles.css"</span> to change the headings located under <span
            class="location">3.1 Fonts</span>.    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Banner Image - to replace the product image, simply replace the image file named <span class="location">book_dummy.png</span> (size - 331px x 451px)</span>
              <br /></li>
          <li>Screenshots - can be changed by replacing the placeholders located under <span class="location">"/images/screenshots/"</span>.
                <br/>
                (thumbnail size - 220px x 140px)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that you remove height and size attributes from your video integration code in order to retain responsiveness for that video clip.</li>
            <li>Please contact support@shapingrain.com if you require assistance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="config">Configuration Interface</h2>
        <p>To make changes easy, OffTheShelf ships with a PHP-based web interface to change styling options and to set up the contact form.</p>
        <p>To set up the configuration interface, simply up the <span class="location">config/</span> folder to your web server and launch the
        interface by opening <span class="location">http://yourwebhost.com/config/</span> in your browser.</p>
        <p>If your files are not writable by the web server, make sure you make <span class="location">/site.settings.php</span>
        and <span class="location">/css/style.css</span> writable by the web server prior to saving your changes. The interface will
        alert you if your permissions need to be changed.</p>
        <p>Please make sure that once your site is set up and no further changes are necessary, to check the <span class="location">"Lock interface to prevent access"</span>
        option to prevent unauthorized access to the configuration panel, and save your settings.</p>
        <p>You may decide not to use the configuration interface at all, in that case simply leave out the <span class="location">config/</span> folder
            when uploading the files to your web server.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="contact">Contact Form</h2>

        <h3>Setting the recipient address</h3>

        <p>OffTheShelf includes a simple form mailer script to provide you with an instant contact form. It ships with
            the theme package as <span class="location">"contact.php"</span> and the only requirement is a
            PHP5-capable web server. We recommend PHP 5.1.0 or higher.</p>

        <p>You can set up the recipient email address through the configuration interface. Simply enter a valid email
            address under section <span class="location">"Form Mailer - Set up the contact form"</span>, and save your
            settings.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can edit /site.settings.php and change the recipient address manually. By default, this points to support@shapingrain.com.</p>

        <h3>How to make any link open the contact form</h3>

        <p>By default the contact form is linked to the envelope icon in the floating sidebar. You can, however, turn any link into one
        that opens the contact form modal window. To do this, please just add class="feedback" to any link, and change the anchor target to "#"
        or "javascript:void();". Please contact support@shapingrain.com if you require further assistance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="newsletter">Newsletter Sign-up Form</h2>

        <p>We provide you with an empty form to integrate your mailing list/email marketing provider.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, since this is a plain HTML template, we cannot automate the process of customization for the sign-up form through
        our configuration interface. But we are still there to help!</p>

        <p>In order to make the form work, you will have to modify the existing markup, specifically the form fields' names, and the action target.
        We provide assistance for setting up the sign-up form with Mailchimp and AWeber, the most popular providers. We may be able to assist you
        in setting up the form with other providers as well. For assistance, please get in touch with support@shapingrain.com.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="support">Support Policy</h2>

        <h3>Contact Support</h3>
        <p>If there is anything we can help you with, please let us know. Whether you have discovered a
        problem or need help customizing our product to fit your needs, we are always happy to help out
        and point you into the right direction. Simply send an email to support@shapingrain.com.</p>
        <p>In order to be able to provide you with the best possible service, we do not offer customer support
        through the comments section on themeforest and we will direct you to contact
        support@shapingrain.com should you seek assistance there. This ensures that no support tickets
        are forgotten and that all members of the support staff are aware of your issue, resulting in the
        fastest and best possible service.</p>
        <p>We may occasionally ask you to provide your license certificate on themeforest to verify your
        purchase.</p>

        <h3>Account Details</h3>
        <p>If necessary to help you solve a problem we may request that you email us your login
        details and/or provide us with your hosting account details as well in order to identify problems
        that are related to your web server environment. Please accept that without those details, we may
        not be able to help you in some cases.</p>

        <h3>Extend of our Support</h3>
        <p>We generally only provide support for our own product. While we will usually make attempts to
        assist you with other issues as well, we will likely have to decline support if the issue exceeds the
        scope of our knowledge and experience.</p>
        <p>Please accept that we generally do not provide support for other third party products except in
        cases where addressing an issue takes only little time. We recommend that you contact support
        and ask if you are unsure whether a particular case is covered by our support policy.</p>

        <h3>Customization</h3>
        <p>Most customization requests we receive do not require much time, and we are happy to assist
        whenever that is the case. If, however, your request would result in more work, we will have to
        restrict our support to giving you basic guidance, or offer you our paid customizations services.</p>
